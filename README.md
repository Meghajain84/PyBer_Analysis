# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Pyber is the python based ride sharing app company. We have been given csv files with driver and ride data in various cities. We need to come up with a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we are required to create multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we will come up with a written report summarizing how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
* As we get into busier areas (from rural to suburban, from suburban to urban), number of rides and drivers using pyber app increases, causing average fare per ride and average fare per driver to decrease. The disparity is particularly significant when compared with urban area.

* Looking at multiple-line chart, as we move from rural to suburban, suburban to urban areas, total fare increases and the trend is same throughout the plotted months. The gap between total fares between urban and suburban, and suburban and rural city types seems comparable.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
(1) move drivers to suburban and rural - encourage - incentive like for eg commission - avg fare per driver

(2) inc urban rate - avg fare per ride

(3) give free ride per few rides in rural area to promote more rides - avg fare per ride
